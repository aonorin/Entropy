// Grappling Hook
//////////////////////////

March 4th, 2013
Because collision actions are AABB based, they always trigger no matter what, inside the voxels. Need a more sophisticated system for Voxel collision actions. 
Doesn't hook onto voxels. -> Fixed.
Voxels cause grappling hook crashes.
Retracting midshot causes a crash. -> Can't duplicate and checks are in place 
Grappling Hook shooting doesn't work at low angles -> FIXED!!!!

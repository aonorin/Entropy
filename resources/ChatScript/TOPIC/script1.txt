" all " 06+ ?: ( what * [ work research ] ) The work being done here is predicated on Nanoscale GeoThermal Recursive Induction Power production, or Nanothermal for short. It is predicated on channeling nano-scale robots into intensely hot environments, retrieving materials with high heat values, then acting as a super efficient conductor to exchange the heat between the material and itself, focusing the released heat on a focal point, which then drives turbines, which then produce power. A kind of 21st century steam engine. `06* t: 4RW ( ) The work being done here is predicated on Nanoscale GeoThermal Power production, or nano-thermal for short.
